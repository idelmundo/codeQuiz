### Steps on what each does
<p>Lines 7-16, Im setting up my variables that way I can point to this later on my code. on line 7-12, I'm pointing to my HTML so that way I can put stuff in there later such as time, questions and high score. Then on line 13-16 I set my variables for counter,time and score.  Here's an example:</p> <img src="s1.png" alt="s1"> 

<br>
<p> Lines 19-51, I started with a function called start I will be using this later on my code and i also added my initial time so that when the game starts it in seconds whihc is on my line 14. I also added nextQuestion() means i want you to run this function on line 35. On line 24-33 I have my compareAnswer function where I build a counter if the answer is correct add a score and time but if its wrong reduce time then it goes to the next question. In line 35-51 I made another function for nextQuestion were i will be placing my question into my html and added my counter so it knows when it done it will move to the next question. I also added a button element and had to append it so that way it can go to my html without it all this work in function will not work. on line 49 i also added endGame which will end the game after 5 questions.  Here's an example: </p>  <img src="s2.png" alt="s2">
